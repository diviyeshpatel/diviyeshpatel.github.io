Focusing away for a moment from career to personal life.

A whole new chapter awaits for a special arrival in the New Year.

Taking the challenges to new heights ‚Äì not just to learn for self nor the team, but to be a father, a husband, a son, a friend, a colleague ‚Äì being there for mentoring and developing, hopefully trying to be the better version of myself to influence the very next!

Feeling nervous, feeling excited, shorter cycles of restless nights appear ahead as the time comes closer. On standby it seems, waiting for the moment to arrive.

Checking the list of things to do, marking them down as actioned once completed. The sense of achievement whilst overwhelmed with generosity from both sides of families/relatives/friends.

Seeing other couples in the same situation and hearing from their perspective and experience, assuring a similar experience.

Give or take, you‚Äôre not alone and sometime flipping the idea of thoughts upside down can surprised one that it‚Äôs all part of a normal lifestyle.

The interesting part is now priorities vs expenditures. When to compromise to enjoy the finest moments vs when to set the limit to save. In search for the right balance is now the new opportunity.

Leaving 2023 a year to celebrate for the things achieved and 2024 for the new beginnings, a fresh chapter.

So let‚Äôs kick this off by letting you all know, with the clues above, as I mentioned previously some may already know..

Say hello!


My wife and I are very excited to annouce the arrival of our little girl Riya Layla Patel born on 18th Jan 2024, weighing 4lbs 11 ounces.

Mummy, Baby and Daddy are all doing well ‚ò∫Ô∏è.

Riya was so excited she made her dramatic entrance earlier then expected and reached home by Friday evening. üíï
