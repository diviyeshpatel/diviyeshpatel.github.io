It seems such an achievement, yet not long ago it was a mission to stay a float.

The struggles were long and hard, but was well worth the shot.

So you want to know exactly what it is one has been working on over the last 5 years…

Here’s a list of some of the objectives, some set from business requirements and others set out for industry standards and of course curiosities.

<ul>
<li>Build a system</li>
<li>Face-lift for systems</li>
<li>New workflows within a pre-existing system</li>
<li>Upgrade in frameworks (Bootstrap 3 to 4)</li>
<li>Introduce new technologies (Vue, Vuex, Router, etc)</li>
<li>Implement quicker methods by simplicity (the use of Vue mixing)</li>
<li>Demonstrate to teams (from features and implementations to DevOps IDE setup)</li>
<li>Keep up with Agile sprints and clear tech debt (continuous improvement)</li>
<li>Board new recruits and help them along the way (build confidence in making changes)</li>
<li>Refactor code and make reusable code bases</li>
<li>Add personality here and there for fun – after all make it enjoyable for everyone to use</li>
<li>Remove clutter that isn’t in use</li>
<li>Re-write shared components in newer technologies (compatibility improvement)</li>
<li>Compile multiple apps into a master application (test trial)</li>
<li>Learn to write test scripts (use of Jest)</li>
<li>Implement more test scripts (in progress to prevent sudden changes)</li>
<li>Create documentation for transformation and consistency</li>
<li>Learning new tools with AI, check and test implementation</li>
</ul>

Of course some tasks needed team work to drive things forward, so congratulations are in favour for those that have helped one understand legacy features, implement better UI/UX and help testing for all of the above.

Same goes to those who are no longer with us and sadly will be missed, but have made such an influence to one and the overall process.

Now there’s one more thing left to mention that some of you may know already.

To be continued…
