Hidden web technologies you might want to know, that’s if you’re a marketer, an online business owner, or if you just hate spyware tracking your every move online activity! Here are some of the tech I have come across while browsing many websites.

Remember privacy is NOT an option, but you can always try though.

I’ve linked most of these web technologies to their official websites for further information.

I might add more to this list as I come across them, so in the meantime help yourself to investigate them.

If you do know more web tech out there, please do leave a comment below – thanks!
