It seems apparent, we’re all in it together (teamwork makes the dream work).

Driving behavioural change in ways that one can understand and adapt (questioning).

Excluding the word I and including others (individuals, teams, departments or cross platform).

Making others aware of the context and giving them credit to the situation (a sense of achievement).

Sharing examples of the past reflections to future enhancements/improvements (simplification of complexities).

Assessing criteria to clarifying misconceptions (missing any detail).

Aligning any hasty judgement with an understanding of logics (2 fast, 2 furious – securing knowledge within speed).

Those logics that cements a clear vision (without needing any visuals).

A vision that can be easily executed and can also be extended (need 4 speed – keeping in sync with process and progress).

Clear mind, clear slate, start fresh (ignite acknowledgment amongst others).

Neither right, nor wrong, hear each other out before proceeding, show examples to reason with and let others clearly see what it is that one is trying to convince.

Recognise the distinction between the two.
