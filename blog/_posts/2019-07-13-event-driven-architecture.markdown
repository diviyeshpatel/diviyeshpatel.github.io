So here’s where my head is at… from working on MVC (modal, view, controller) using JQuery and JS to manipulate single pages to building reusable components and converting the current state of software to single page application… was something on the horizon, but yet not discovered – knowing/ hearing the tech industry is shifting in that direction.

The new process reduces the amount of callbacks to the servers, which on a large scale, is a huge factor for medium to large scale businesses that rely on online activity every day.

The main positive impact is saving server processes which leads to less server maintenance and the amount of servers processing.

Preventing servers from computing overtime or overclocking, which leads to increase in heat and burnout – one of the main reasons why servers need a maintain temperature room.

The new process allows online users to process the data from client side and then return the data back to the servers.

The end result is fast and efficient, browsing experience.

Here we are scaling up as a team, thinking on decision what is possible and what are shades of gray.

As we build, trail and error, finding problems along the way and realising there are many methods to get to the end goal.

The main issue lies in the decision making, which path as a team we should take given what other problems may occur when scaling applications up.

When you get to the specific details on how to pass data around components to manipulate and store gets complex, dealing with a framework that’s new and gives options, but yet as a language executes on load.
