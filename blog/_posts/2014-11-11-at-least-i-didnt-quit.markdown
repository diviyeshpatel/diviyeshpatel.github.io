It all happened so soon and I thought I could turn things around when things got tough.

It’s been just over 2 months finished at my current employment, ending in a sticky situation with a client and company management. My job was terminated; I was told to leave and had been paid out.

The dilemma when client don’t stick to agreements and ignore advice from company management, to management given up convincing what’s best for their future business and eventually leading to agreeing with client. All in all, resulting with work that may not generate great online experience with users, nor develop better sales.

I battled hard during the last 3 months of employment to keep simplicity and usability the main focus of online experience and still there were complex ideas being added. By complex ideas being those that would tarnish user experience.

Looking back at this situation, I can say this was an experience, an experience that management would see as usual on a daily basis to make client perform better than their previous.

During my time in employment, I realised not everyone had the same thinking process, which made technical know how discussions harder in meetings without demonstrations of examples. This point seems to be the norm in many businesses after listening to a wide range of web podcasts. So, I feel not alone here.

I’m back out in the market of employability, now looking for another vacancy with some new experience.

Having just over a year experience including the 3-month probation period, moving forward and overcoming this situation, I found it hard ignoring the negatives and thinking positive, especially when going back into interviewing process.

But this didn’t stop me, I had nothing to hide and clearly had great online present from previous activities to date.

The day I left I tried something different I met a few recruiters. I discussed my situation and my concerns and listened to their procedures and T&C’s. Many said I was very brave to start looking straight away. Together we drew plans to action and proceeded applying to relevant and suitable vacancies. As time went by more recruiters had been in contact and a similar process started again with telephone calls.

At this point, I have never had to talk to so many recruiters all wanting to know something about me. I felt there were different views forming from this.

Why choose a recruiter to proceed with vacancies, why not apply directly with companies, why not have more than one recruiter to find suitable vacancies?

These were just some of the thoughts running through my mind at the time and have tried all in respect and respected those who have helped me in the process.

Recruiters should know their clients very well and know what employers are actually after and having more than one recruiter can cause concerned to both parties, that’s if they apply to the same vacancy twice. Companies may also be thinking one may not have much self-respect, passion or care about their career, if they rely on others to do their work. After all, if one doesn’t have self-respect, clearly they don’t have respect for anyone else.

Doing nothing will cost, therefore trying something will gain, whether it’s good or bad, aim to stand out. At least one has tried; one hadn’t quit and remains positive to try again!
