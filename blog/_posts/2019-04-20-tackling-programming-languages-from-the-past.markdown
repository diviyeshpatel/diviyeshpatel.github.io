Tasked to solve – is pretty much what one has been doing to date.

Not knowing, but yet comfortable challenging them while time is ticking away.

Rewind back to years, where self teaching new programming languages was ever so daunting.

The instincts of knowing a language that would update in increments or a full re-write that would extend maintenance time and having to explain that up the chain.

Working with PHP this week and some experience of WordPress remembered in the past – felt like a task that one should attempt, be it if one has only touch the surface of this language.

The attempt was successful and the feeling of confidence has gained tremendous.

So the lesson learned here was be calm and carry on.
