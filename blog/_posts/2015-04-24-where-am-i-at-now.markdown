Over my 6 month probation period and not knowing where I am, puts me on edge.

When things are getting overcomplicated as more work is coming in for your boss to deal with while dealing with internal problems doesn’t really help.

There has been this continuous workflow problem since the day I started where work is getting overwritten and some of us are repeating what we have just finished.

Having backup of this helped me so many times to fix those mistakes quickly. But how do you stop professionals who know what they are doing, but disrupting the workflow process? What happens if they are the ones that are teaching us what to do too?

You have the choice to tell your boss, but they are just blanking what your saying and putting both employees in a meeting room to find a solution to stop this overwriting workflow from happening.

You’ve given your opinion based on previous experiences and they still go with a different solution, the workflow still seems sketchy. There is no record of what we are actually edited between each other. I think this is vital for when things doesn’t work as expected.

Is it really a mistake after several mistakes or is it a way to put employees in the bad books of their boss, especially of employees that have nearly fulfilled their time?

I would prefer it if employers just communicated this directly, rather than getting others to do this.

Of course this isn’t going to happen as they don’t want you work for another company, especially in the same industry or their competitors.

That’s life, complicated.
