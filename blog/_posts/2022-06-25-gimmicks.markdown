As we get older, we get wiser.

We tend to have less time as more responsibilities grow.

In time those have to be sorted by priorities.

Additional drivers causes conflicts.

Those are being talented, being kind and helpful where needed.

Day to day activities include solving many issues and answering many questions.

Questions on the 5 W’s and H of course.

Most of the time, just being present helps, just don’t ask how.

Because of these attractions, there’s also noise from doing the current task in hand.

It could be internal or external. Being at work or leisure.

It could be anything unconfirmed and mentioned later.

Quite frankly, if it doesn’t do any favours then don’t even bother.

You’re wasting you’re precious time.

Time that costs.

Shame it sounds harsh, but that’s reality.

Now, if you’re thinking the opposite…

To make a difference, you need to continuously chase it.

No matter how hard it is, never give up.

One day you’ll get lucky.
