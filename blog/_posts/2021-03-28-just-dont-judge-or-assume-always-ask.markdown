When in doubt that is or when there are other great talent around you.

But when that isn’t the case, try going by experience.

Then if you don’t have that, try learning it on your own.

Don’t blame on it, you could be doing it wrong yourself.

Try finding those that have the experience.

You can trade a skill for another or introduce a new to replace.

You can always ask and ask what’s its worth.

Bottom line…

It could be worth your while.
