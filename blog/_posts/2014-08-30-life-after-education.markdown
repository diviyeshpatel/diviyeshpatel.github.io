Before you start reading this post, I would just like to mention I created this half way through my current employment and was hoping to finish this at the end of year, but time just seems to fly when your busy working and then later in the evening keeping active – the gym! (Even after sitting at a desk all day and again staying awake till midnight or early mornings doing the things mentioned below). Anyway hope you enjoy reading and keep smiling!

I think it’s that time of year where I need to post an update on what I’ve been getting up to, and why some things have changed that may have affected my online behaviour and the social communities who have supported me – again I cannot stress how grateful the online community have been.

Previously I used my skills learnt from my upbringing to pay for a small, but mighty course after studying a degree.

These days a degree is not enough in this world to get by with nor will masters (unless its top notch).

You may ask why…

So here’s the gap, many student either learn to test their abilities or get help and learn from their tutors and other students around them.

I can argue my belief was from both sides, whether there was a set standard of coding right or wrong and at the same time if I got stuck at self studying, who do I go to for help?

It’s now clear after working as an employee, why many people in this industry would say education is teaching old skills and why there are so many students left behind after studying further without jobs.

In my line of work, there are new technologies appearing faster than I can grasp. My methodology is to work on the new, before it’s too late.

So it’s been a year from now working as an employee for Telescope Studios and in that time frame I’ve learnt so much from employment and self-taught.

During working hours I make digital content like websites, videos, online catalogues and magazines, post blogs and social feeds, etc. By night I enjoy researching, testing, what is possible and what isn’t – just for leisure and experience. If there was a gap for the market, I would usually exploit it via my social feeds, Twitter, Facebook, etc for the online community to share my passion and vision.

I like open-source and support it as it gives everyone an opportunity to get involved in future projects and advance those ideas that are worthy of development.

I used my personal website that would give some clues and resources how I design, code, my interests, what I do and learned to transform this into an Android app (now available on the market, to download just type: DIV BOT).

The app was just a test and trail to see if it worked, which seems to via my devices.

You may also be wondering why DIV BOT – well it’s part of my branding, career role and partly my nick name… DIV BOT = Design In Variety, Build On Technology = Front End Developer

I also made my own custom workstation computer competing with high-end desktop and workstations without any help, but the web.

Some of these things are just life goals that I wanted to do and have now covered. Now my mission is coding apps.

I did start half way through the year teaching myself Objective C for IOS devices, making card games, but in the recent Apple Web Conference there is another new language and that is now my main focus currently.

Although studying old materials are not fully suitable for employment, it does lay down the basic foundations in which you can progress further by self-study.

The web is really full of great resources and it’s just the matter of how you find and use it to your abilities.
