It’s becoming more apparent these days. Businesses under attack by imitation.

If you see emails or text messages claiming to be from a well known company, how do you tackle it?

Delete it, ignore it, report it as spam via email providers/services, or report it to the official company who they claim to be?

Now a days, many medium to large scale companies have a security division who will investigate further.

So how do you report them?

Easy, just search for the company and keyword ‘report spam’ in any search engine.

Ignoring any advertisements, usually you’ll get the correct website along with how to report scams.

The procedure is simple just forward the fake email to them or forward the fake text message to ‘7726’ for further investigation.

Word of advice just don’t go clicking any links within the email or text message, nor fill any details via the link.
