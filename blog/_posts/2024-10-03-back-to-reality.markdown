Since Riya was born, we’ve been pretty occupied learning new things about ourselves.

Between us, our families, relatives and friends, it has been a joy to share the new feelings.

Some feelings that are overwhelmingly dramatic, for example feeding to be accomplished within time constraints, otherwise she will let you know about it!

Learning this trait exposed how to multitask across multi-sprint related projects.

Being capable of switching up spontaneously the thought and actioning process behind development.

Arguably this could cause a knock on effect, missing out on any vital information due to the sense, or… nature of urgency.

It’s the minor details that usually get left behind as an afterthought, which then becomes an amendment to the list of things to accommodate for.

The drawbacks of having to think at what stage the projects state was left in still rings sirens.

With tools in place to monitor this, it becomes another task in finding out.

But nevertheless that’s business.

A company needs to somewhat level the field with their, the clients, the customers requirements and to fulfill strategies to meet those expectations.

You could throw in the towel and say… we’re humans after all, expect it! – Inevitably it’s true!

We make mistakes, and learn from, to move on.

The oversight to all this is repetitiveness in its implementation and a real time sucker to restructure the development workflow.

We need to think out side the box a little here.

Think of how things would work in terms of data science here.

What data sets do we have and how to access this across multiple web applications without the need to call multiple APIs just to fetch data.

Connecting the requirements together is always a challenge from sprint to sprint, without having the birds eye view of which application it will affect.

An outside perspective in with the knowledge to fulfill those missing gaps is what is required and to validate the idea with the wider development team if it’s possible is all that is needed.
