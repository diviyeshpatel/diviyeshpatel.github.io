Spare a moment?

Teach if you can.

Invest in some time.

Learn as much as you can.

Perhaps…

Share a thought together.

Maybe if you’re lucky…

Trade a skill for another?

Who knows what you’ll might find.

From entry level to fullstack…

There’s always something to learn.

Call it what you want.

The cycle of learning forms teaching.

Imagine and reiterate.

The above with the below.

Apply methods with different contexts.
