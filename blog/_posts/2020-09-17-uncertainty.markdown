As human beings we assume a lot, but realising after it’s not the case anymore.

We accept those that have worked longer in employment to know more.

But when we talk about agendas, we realised that’s not the case.

Opening up and talking about topics we enjoy can show how in depth knowledge we may know and also highlight to those that may didn’t know.

But it’s a start.

By accepting they don’t know raises awareness to those that can teach. Be open to understand why we do certain things in the way we do.

There are concept designs, there are many theories on different agendas, then there’s the practical side of implementation with time limits.

The puzzle is knowing each strength and to pull together our minds to solve existing problems in the manner of time.

Continuous reviews draws continuous improvements, adds value across the board.

Change is unavoidable, but can be greatly rewarded in time.
