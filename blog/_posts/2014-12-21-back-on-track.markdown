Just over 3 months jobless, but hunger for work – I was hired to get the work done in time for Christmas & New Year.

It’s been 2 weeks, half way in the month of December, picking up the business workflow and finding myself fit in the role as Front End Developer working with, between designer and developer on board.

I saw opportunities to boost workflow and technologies, which is currently in process for the New Year.

There were stacks of client work that needed creating, amending existing and finishing current work before Christmas – so a quick turnaround solution was needed.

Coming from a background learning popular software and new technologies, I had to step back and backtrack to using old for temporary basis – I knew the company was in a transitioning period, where it just so happen, I managed to blend in well.

3 clients websites all needed to be published live and another, a few tweaks here and there on the live site.

Lucky enough all the work met its deadline and happened so quickly just on time!

This is the shortest blog I have done and a glimpse of the beginning to a fresh new start for the New Years.

Merry Christmas & a Happy New Year!
