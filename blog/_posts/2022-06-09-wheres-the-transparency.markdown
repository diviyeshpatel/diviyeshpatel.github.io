Another key element along with communication is transparency.

It’s great communicating information between people, but where’s the transparency around it.

Allow me to explain.

Communication can be easily be lost in translation and also be misunderstood.

It also gets harder with groups of people in meetings, leading to more complexity and become notorious for multiple meetings.

For the purpose of having a meeting, each meeting should conclude informative information, improvements or solutions.

Meanwhile in meetings taking a minute to pause, listen, observe and take information on board, can also help improve the next response in line of communication aka feedback.

Sometimes trying to make a point across can sound negative, but with reasons it helps ease the situation and makes one think more about the point of concern.

Point of concerns shouldn’t be a blame game, but a valid concern that should lead to providing solutions on improving the situation.
